              <p className="text-xl text-left text-accent dark:text-text-primary-dark mb-8">{`Hello and welcome to my website!  First, a little background information on me.  I am a former Army combat medic with a B.S. in Biology from the University of Albany in NY and have an M.S. in Health and Human Performance with a specialization in strength and conditioning from Canisius University in Buffalo, NY.  I am currently a registered professional member of the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA), a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist with Distinction (CSCS,*D), and a NSCA Certified Personal Trainer with Distinction (NSCA-CPT,*D).`}</p>
              <br/>
              <p className="text-xl text-left text-accent dark:text-text-primary-dark mb-8">I enjoy combining my medical knowledge with proper program design and exercise technique to help individuals with weight loss, increased strength, building muscle, improving sport performance, injury prevention, injury rehabilitation, and just moving better. I do not create a one-size-fits-all program for my clients, but rather a custom-built program that is appropriate for your age, lifestyle, and fitness level. My philosophy is that your goals can be achieved with consistency and patience. I do not promote extreme programs or diet plans that claim you will lose 10 pounds of fat in a week or some other ridiculous promise. Not all my clients end up reaching their goals, but the ones that do are the ones that are consistent week after week with their workouts, sleep, and nutrition. It does not have to be a suffering process, but a gradual lifestyle change that is enjoyable.</p>
