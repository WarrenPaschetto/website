I am stronger than I’ve ever been and feel great. Warren not only helps me with strength training, but also developed a nutrition plan for me as well. He is always available to help any time I have questions. I can text Warren at any time with a question about my workouts or nutrition and he is always able to help. Warren helped me develop a strength training routine that I can do on my own as well to supplement the training sessions with him. I strongly recommend Warren to anyone looking to lose weight, gain strength or just get healthier. He is able to customize fitness and nutrition regimens to meet any goals that you might have.",

While waiting for the surgery, I gained quite a bit of weight and lost a lot of muscle mass. But in the short time I’ve been going to see Warren, I’ve lost weight, lost body fat and gained muscle tone. I work out with Warren four days a week. We do upper body twice a week and lower body twice a week. I never get bored with our workouts because he changes up my routine regularly enough that there’s not time to get bored with it. He has increased my weights when he notices that I am ready. Warren is very dedicated and it’s quite obvious that he cares a great deal about the health and well-being of his clients. His schedule is rather flexible and he’s always there when he says he will be. He works with both your training and your nutrition, if you want. Warren is very capable, highly trained and skilled. His experience and education are impressive, but even more impressive is the person behind the letters MS, CSCS and NSCA-CPT. I challenge you to find anyone as skilled and trained as Warren who has the same humility. He’s a great guy to work out with whether you’re 18 or 80, male or female. And whether you’re looking to build muscle or lose fat, he’ll have a plan for you in the gym and the kitchen.",

As a former college athlete, I struggled keeping an athletic physique after entering the working world, and decided it was time to get serious about my nutrition. It was the reason I chose Warren, because I was working out, but had no idea how to feed my body to get the best results. Warren created recipes, and laid out when I should eat, and let me take it from there. I will be continuing with Warren because I don’t want to stop, I want to keep pushing, and I know he can take me where I want to go. So if you’re like I was five weeks ago, hesitant, self-conscious, don’t be, try it out, you’ll be back.",
